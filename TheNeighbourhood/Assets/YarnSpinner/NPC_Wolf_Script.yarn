// Voraussetzung: Zweiter Dialog mit Caro wurde beendet, sie schickt einen los, um Zutaten zu holen. 

// Man interagiert mit der Wolf-Tür 
(Knock, knock) // Tom kommt raus 
Tom: Oh, you're early. Thank goodness! 
Lilly: Uh-
Tom: Vanessa, was it? I'm Tom. 
Tom: Seriously, you're <i>really</i> saving our night by taking care of our little troublemaker.
Tom: I won't sugarcoat it, though. He has been acting up ever since he discovered our cookie jar.
Tom: I'm telling you, Vanessa. From one stranger to another: the whole family thing? 
Tom: Think well about it in advance if that's the path you choose, will you? 
Lilly: Uh, I'm sorry but...
Lilly: Well, I'm not Vanessa.
Tom: You're- oh...
Tom: Wait, who are you then? 
Lilly: I'm, uh, Lilly. Yeah, your neighbour. Down there, that's us. 
Tom: Oh. Right, the new neighbours!
Tom: Alright, I don't have much time but how can I help?
Lilly: Well, so. It's, uh... I've been baking and I just realized I'm out of flour. 
Tom: How nice! What are you baking?
Lilly: A... cake. Birthday cake, yeah. 
Tom: Congratulations! Who's the lucky fella? 
Lilly: I... um... well...
Tom: Oh, shoot! Sorry, Lilly, I have to get ready for my night out. 
Tom: But I'm sure we have some spare flour. One second. 
// Tom verschwindet, kommt wieder
Tom: There you go, you can keep all of it. // Flour erscheint im Inventar
Tom: Also, what I said earlier about family... I'm sorry. 
Tom: I just meant to say that it requires a lot of work and patience and-
Tom: Nevermind, I'm holding both of us up. So, I just hope you have a great party. Enjoy yourself!
Tom: Oh, and: welcome to your new home!
Lilly: Thank you!
// Tom verschwindet
Lilly: (That was … special.)
Lilly: (A birthday cake, though? Seriously, Lilly?)
Lilly: (I doubt that lying is better than the risk of becoming one-dimensional.)
Lilly: (Or is it?)
Lilly: (Either way, no more hiding, Lilly.)
